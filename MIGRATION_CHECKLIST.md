## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Migration Script Errors

**Error: "Could not load default credentials"**
- Solution: Make sure `serviceAccountKey.json` exists in `scripts/` folder
- Solution: Check file path in environment variable

**Error: "Organization does not exist"**
- Solution: Verify organization ID: `pWiofGzlPXMfoBNoMbP6`
- Solution: Check Firebase Console for correct org ID

**Error: "Permission denied"**
- Solution: Ensure service account has "Firebase Admin SDK Administrator Service Agent" role
- Solution: Regenerate service account key

### App Errors After Migration

**"Permission denied" when viewing data**
- Check that new Firestore rules are deployed
- Verify rules in Firebase Console
- Check organizationId is set correctly for users

**Data not showing up**
- Check Firebase Console to verify migration completed
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify organizationId lookup is working

**Old data still appearing**
- App might be caching old queries
- Clear browser cache
- Do hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
