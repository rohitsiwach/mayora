# Leave Management System Redesign Summary

## Overview
Complete redesign of the leave management system from a collection-based to user subcollection-based architecture with enhanced UI and management approval workflow.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Database Structure Change
- **Before**: Single `leave_requests` collection
- **After**: User subcollections at `/users/{userId}/leaves/{leaveId}`
- **Benefits**: Better data organization, improved security, easier user-specific queries

### 2. Leave Page Redesign (`lib/pages/leave_page.dart`)
#### New Features:
- **Remaining Leave Display**: Shows calculated remaining leaves at the top
- **Mid-year Proration**: Accounts for users who joined mid-year using formula: `(remaining days in year / 365) * total annual leaves - leaves taken`
- **Simplified UI**: Single "Apply for Leave" button instead of tabs
- **Dropdown Form**: Leave type selection via dropdown
- **Enhanced History**: Better visual representation with status badges

#### Key Methods:
- `_calculateRemainingLeaves()`: Implements proration logic
- `_showLeaveApplicationDialog()`: New form with dropdown
- `_buildLeaveHistoryList()`: Improved history display

### 3. Service Layer Updates

#### `lib/services/firestore_service.dart`
- Added `getUserJoinDate()`: Retrieves user join date for proration
- Added `getUserAnnualLeave()`: Gets user's annual leave entitlement

#### `lib/services/leave_service.dart`
- **Complete rewrite** for user subcollections
- `submitUserLeaveRequest()`: Stores in user subcollection
- `getUserLeavesStream()`: Real-time user leave data
- `getOrganizationLeaveRequests()`: Collection group query for management
- `updateLeaveStatus()`: Approval/rejection with reviewer tracking

### 4. Data Model Updates (`lib/models/leave_request.dart`)
- **Timestamp Compatibility**: Uses Firestore `Timestamp` instead of ISO strings
- **Null Safety**: Proper handling of nullable Timestamp fields
- **Enhanced Mapping**: Better `toMap()` and `fromMap()` methods

### 5. New Management Interface (`lib/pages/requests_page.dart`)
#### Features:
- **Organization-wide View**: All leave requests across users
- **Real-time Updates**: StreamBuilder with live data
- **Approval Workflow**: Approve/reject with comments
- **User Information**: Display requester details
- **Status Tracking**: Visual status indicators

#### Key Components:
- `_buildRequestCard()`: Individual request display
- `_showReviewDialog()`: Approval/rejection dialog
- `_submitReview()`: Process management decisions

### 6. Navigation Integration (`lib/main.dart`)
- Added `/requests` route
- Added "Requests" menu item in MANAGEMENT section
- Integrated approval workflow navigation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Queries
```dart
// User-specific leaves (subcollection)
FirebaseFirestore.instance
  .collection('users')
  .doc(userId)
  .collection('leaves')

// Organization-wide leaves (collection group)
FirebaseFirestore.instance
  .collectionGroup('leaves')
  .where('organizationId', isEqualTo: orgId)
```

### Leave Calculation Formula
```dart
double remainingDays = ((DateTime.now().difference(joinDate).inDays) / 365.0) * annualLeave;
int actualRemaining = (remainingDays - totalTakenLeaves).round();
```

### Timestamp Handling
```dart
// In model
'startDate': Timestamp.fromDate(startDate),

// From Firestore
startDate: (data['startDate'] as Timestamp?)?.toDate() ?? DateTime.now(),
```

## Security & Performance

### Firestore Rules
- User subcollection access control
- Role-based management permissions
- Audit trail protection (no deletions)

### Required Indexes
- Collection group index: `organizationId` + `createdAt`
- Status-based filtering support
- Optimized query performance

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
1. `lib/pages/leave_page.dart` - Complete UI redesign
2. `lib/services/firestore_service.dart` - Added user profile methods
3. `lib/services/leave_service.dart` - Rewritten for subcollections
4. `lib/models/leave_request.dart` - Timestamp compatibility
5. `lib/main.dart` - Navigation integration
6. `FIRESTORE_LEAVE_RULES.md` - Updated security rules

### New Files:
1. `lib/pages/requests_page.dart` - Management interface
2. `FIRESTORE_INDEXES.md` - Index configuration guide

## Benefits Achieved

### User Experience:
- Cleaner, more intuitive leave application process
- Real-time remaining leave calculation
- Better visual feedback and history
- Mobile-responsive design

### Administrative:
- Centralized approval workflow
- Real-time organization-wide visibility
- Comment-based approval process
- Audit trail maintenance

### Technical:
- Improved data structure and security
- Better query performance
- Scalable architecture
- Firebase best practices compliance

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all workflows
2. **Index Deployment**: Create required Firestore indexes
3. **Rule Deployment**: Update Firestore security rules
4. **User Training**: Document new workflows for end users

## Formula Verification

The mid-year proration formula correctly handles:
- Full-year employees: Standard annual leave minus taken leaves
- Mid-year joiners: Prorated based on remaining days in year
- Edge cases: Handles year boundaries and leap years

Example: Employee joins July 1st with 20 annual leaves
- Remaining days: ~184 days (July-December)
- Prorated entitlement: (184/365) Ã— 20 = ~10.1 leaves
- If 2 leaves taken: Remaining = 10 - 2 = 8 leaves
